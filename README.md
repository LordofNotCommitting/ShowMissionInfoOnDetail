Look, often times I don't know where I am at, what I was doing or who I was fighting because I alt+tab to look at bird picture or something. I need them mission info on my screen. This mod does that.

**Enemy concentration info will be displayed incorrectly for the first 10 missions if you have "easier starting missions" enabled. After 10 missions it should match actual concentration.**

But more clear version since I just want screen to tell exactly who my enemy is. That is what matters for your armor pick anyway.
